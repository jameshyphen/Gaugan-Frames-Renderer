# Gaugan-Frames-Renderer

### What?

This is a small script written in python with Selenium and plenty of other stuff.
The point is to have a folder with frames you wish to convert to a Nvidia/Gaugan rendered movie.

I've added some example frames into the 01_test_GauGan folder.


### How to run?
You will need to have pipenv installed.
Create a python environment and run the convert.py

```sh
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
$ python convert.py
```

### Credits
Script was written by James Hyphen.
This project is in collaboration with Arthur Zwartjes.
He's writing a paper on Gaugan and deeplearning in movie making.
The script is used to automate his movie frames rendering into Gaugan frames.
